# Understanding TypeScript Core Types

- TypeScript introduces several core types like `number`, `string`, and `boolean`.
- In TypeScript, there's no distinction between integers and floating-point numbers; all numbers are considered floating-point.
- JavaScript is dynamically typed and uses the `typeof` operator to check types at runtime.
- TypeScript, being statically typed, checks types during development, preventing runtime errors.
- TypeScript allows you to specify types for function parameters, ensuring type safety.
- You can use conditional checks to customize behavior based on types.
- TypeScript helps catch type-related issues early in development.
- Core types in TypeScript are fundamental for building type-safe applications.
