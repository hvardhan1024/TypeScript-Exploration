# TypeScript and Core Data Types

- TypeScript provides various data types to JavaScript.
- JavaScript itself has some data types, but TypeScript adds more.
- TypeScript allows you to define custom types.

## Core Data Types

- **Number:** There is only one `number` type in JavaScript and TypeScript, covering both integers and floats.
- **String:** Strings can be defined with single quotes, double quotes, or backticks for template literals.
  - Template literals allow dynamic data injection into strings.
- **Boolean:** The `boolean` data type includes only two values: `true` and `false`.

## Type Checking in TypeScript

- TypeScript helps catch type-related errors during development.
- It does not change JavaScript's behavior at runtime but provides checks and assistance during development.
- TypeScript can help prevent common type-related mistakes, such as passing a string instead of a number to a function.
- Visual Studio Code provides built-in TypeScript support, highlighting errors during development.
- TypeScript errors are shown in the IDE and appear during compilation.
- TypeScript helps identify and fix type-related issues before converting code to JavaScript.
- It improves code quality and avoids runtime errors caused by type mismatches.
- TypeScript adds an extra layer of sanity checks to your development process.
